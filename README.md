# Time Chicken
All the other creatures of the realm fear The Demons - their eggs must be destroyed before they hatch, before they grow to their full power.

At least, that's what they say. But somewhere between travelling and mastering magic: you learned to value all life - no matter how terrifying.

Escape the realm and protect the egg from the forces of good.

You are Time Chicken. The Chicken with powers. Time powers.
